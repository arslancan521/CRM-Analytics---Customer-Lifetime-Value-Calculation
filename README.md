![customer-lifetime-value](customer-lifetime-value.jpg)

#### CLTV = (CUSTOMER VALUE / CHURN RATE) * PROFIT MARGIN
#### CUSTOMER VALUE = AVERAGE ORDER VALUE * PURCHASE FREQUENCY
#### CHURN RATE (CONSTANT FOR COMPANY) = 1 - REPEAT RATE
#### REPEAT RATE = NUMBER OF CUSTOMER WHO ORDER MORE THAN ONE / TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS
#### AVERAGE ORDER VALUE = TOTAL REVENUE / TOTAL TRANSACTION
#### PURCHASE FREQUENCY = TOTAL TRANSACTION / TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS
#### PROFIT MARGIN = TOTAL REVENUE / PROFIT RATE



#### An example of calculation the CLTV

The company's and the customer's information are below;

The Company's;
Total Number Of Customers : 100
Churn Rate : 0.8
Profit Rate : 0.1

The Customer's
Total Amount Of Transactions : 1200
Total Number Of Transactions : 3

Calculation of this customer's CLTV:

Average Order Value : 1200 / 3 = 400
Purchase Frequency : 3 / 100 = 0.03
Customer Value : 400 * 0.03 = 12
Profit Margin : 1200 * 0.1 = 120
CLTV : (12 / 0.8) * 120 = 1800
